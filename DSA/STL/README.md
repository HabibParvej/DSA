# Revised README content
# Coding Repository

Welcome to my personal coding repository! Here, I upload my code files across various topics, including data structures, algorithms, STL (Standard Template Library) in C++. This repository serves as a collection of my work and projects, showcasing my coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on topics and projects. Each folder contains code files related to specific areas of study or particular projects I am working on.

### Folder Structure:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** - Solutions to various DSA problems.
- **STL (Standard Template Library) in C++** - Examples and usage of STL components like vectors, maps, sets, etc., in C++.
- **Machine Learning** - Code related to machine learning projects and experiments.
- **Miscellaneous** - Any other code files that don't fall under the above categories.

## Technologies and Languages Used

- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (for ML projects)

## How to Use

Feel free to explore any of the folders and files. Each project folder may contain a separate README file with specific details and instructions.
